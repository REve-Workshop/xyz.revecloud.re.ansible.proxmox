* Usage
** Synopsis
   #+begin_src shell
     ansible-playbook -i <inventory> add-container.yml -e "ct_def_file=<definition_file.yml>"
   #+end_src
** Description
   This playbook allows to create an LXC container with one disk and
   one network interface, on a proxmox virtualization environment.

   - =<inventory>=, the path to the inventory file referencing the
     proxmox REST API entry-point host.
   - =<definition_file.yml>=, the path to a file describing the
     virtual machine to create.

   Creation steps:
   - Calling proxmox to reserve the necessary resources to create the
     container
     - CPU.
     - Memory.
     - The Network interface.
     - Creation of a disk
     - Installing an image on the disk.
   - Start the virtual machine.
   - Install remote acces softwares (SSH server, MoSH)

   If the =<inventory>= file contains more than the proxmox REST API
   entry-point host, use the =--limit= option to restrict the list of
   hosts to loop over for the play.

   You need to connect to the host with a user that have the correct
   permission to administer the proxmox cluster.

   The user must have, at least, the following permission:
   - Can access the REST API entry-point.
   - Can run pve* commands.

   The following variables needs to be defined for the connection to
   the proxmox REST API:
   - =proxmox_cluster_host=: The host of the proxmox cluster to send
     requests to.
   - =proxmox_node=: The node where the container must be created.
   - =proxmox_user=: The proxmox user that will perform the action.
   - =proxmox_password=: the proxmox user's password.
   - =proxmox_pool=: The proxmox resource pool where the container will be
     affected.

   As those variables will not change across runs, a good place to set
   them is in the =host_vars= file of the proxmox host. The only
   exception is =proxmox_pool=, each container can be in a different
   resource pool, following there usage.

   Example of =host_vars= file content:
   #+begin_src yaml
     proxmox_cluster_host: localhost
     proxmox_node: node1
     proxmox_user: root@pam
     proxmox_password: "my secret pwd"
     proxmox_pool: "cesspool"
   #+end_src

   The =<definition_file.yml>= must contain the following
   variables:
   - =hostname=: The name of the container to create.
   - =root_pwd=: The password to set for the root user of the
     container.
   - =cpus=: The number of cpus to allocate.
   - =memory=: The size of the memory (in Mb) to allocate.
   - =swap=: The amount of swap (in Mb) to allocate.
   - =disk=: The size of the root disk (in Gb).
   - =image=: The name of the container image to use to create the
     container.
   - =ostype=: The OS distribution in the image.
   - =osver=: The version of the OS distribution in the image.
   - =storage=: The name of the proxmox storage to use to host the
     root disk.
   - =pubkey=: The SSH public key, to install, in the root user account,
     to allow remote connection without password.
   - =gw=: The gateway of the network interface.
   - =ip=: The ip address to attach to the network interface.
   - =subnet=: The subnet of the ip range.
   - =bridge=: The network bridge, set in proxmox, to link the network
     interface to.

   While any image can be used, for installing the remote access
   softwares, only some distributions are supported:
   - Fedora: =ostype == fedora and ostype >= 30=
   - CentOS: =ostype == centos and ostype >= 8=

   Example of container definition file content:
   #+begin_src yaml

     root_pwd: "root secret"
     hostname: ct-fc31-test
